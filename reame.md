### HTTP REQUESTS

This application was built to understand the basic core concepts of HTTP request using JavaScript. By using the XML object, I was able to send GET, POST, and delete requests to a mock API. Also, I was able to Parsing JSON data to be used in the application. This also gave me a wider view of the JavaScript promise API and the power behind it.

### Usage
